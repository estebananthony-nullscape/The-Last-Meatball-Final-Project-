    <h1>The Last Meatball</h1>
    <h2>By Anthony Esteban</h2>
    <p>A short animation about two frinds who share a plate of meatballs, until eventually, there is one last meatball left. Instead of understanding each other or having common sense, the two fight for it, until eventually, one of them realizes they're no match for the other, and decide to split it. This was a random idea that popped in my head, but it could also give an idea of how certain problems require simple solutions. </p>
